{"company": "Column", "jobTitle": "Software Engineer", "jobDescription": "<div>\n <h2 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>About Column</b></h2>\n <p> For companies building financial technology and transforming the financial services space, the biggest bottleneck to their growth and innovation is often the underlying banks and infrastructure stack they rely on. We have spent our careers founding and scaling companies like Plaid, Square, SoFi, Blend, and Affirm, and have seen this problem firsthand — builders and developers needing to partner with traditional banks, and creating API and abstraction layers over the patchwork that is the bank, its core, and many other vendors. All of this results in a complex (and often expensive) banking supply chain involving a user, fintech, BaaS middleware provider, bank, core and the Federal Reserve.</p>\n <p><br> At Column, we set out to simplify and fix this. We are a bank and a software company built from the ground up, offering builders and developers technology-forward banking solutions that cut out the hundreds of vendors, middleware providers, and abstraction layers.

We generally prefer candidates with at least five years of production coding experience at a high caliber and high velocity team. We’ll require a take-home that does take time, so if that’s a non-starter for you we’re sorry.

Exceptions made on a case-by-case basis for exceptional candidates willing to relocate or travel.</p>\n<p>This role is for a Senior Full Stack Developer with an active TS/SCI clearance who is comfortable with Full Stack Web Development using JavaScript/Typescript. This job will allow a combination of working remotely and customer onsite work up to multiple days a week. When working remotely this role will be unclassified but we need you to go onsite 2-3 days a week to help deploy code, diagnose issues, and architect solutions to problems as they arise in classified test environments. This role is very different from the typical system integrator job and is for highly motivated results-oriented top performers who enjoy working with talented peers on a fast paced product team that is focused on delivering value to customers as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>What We Do</p>\n<p>The team at MapLarge builds cutting edge products for data analytics and visualization to make us safer, more productive, and more efficient. The MapLarge API provides real-time geospatial analytics for over 15 billion location events per day and trillions of historical events. Analysts using our geospatial visualization capability can instantly visualize and publish for data discovery and model testing on any desktop, mobile, or tablet device.</p>\n<p>Who We Need - Types of Roles</p>\n<p>We need talented people to help our customer’s success using our platform.

The key trait we are looking for is self-starting people who like to both architect/design and write the code for complex systems.</p>\n<ul>\n <li><b>Client Side</b> - We maintain a JavaScript API for interactive Data Visualization using our high performance web services. We need people both to help add new dynamic animated UI components and other features to the JS API. We also need people to build data driven visuals for our demo</li>\n <li><b>Full Stack Web Services</b> - Full stack developers who are comfortable working on both client and server side to produce high performance applications powered by scalable web services are the backbone of our team. We run C# in .Net Core server side and also maintain a flexible client side API with a large library of reusable components. We host and run large deployments that sometimes scale to thousands of computers for scientific/industrial/government users.</li>\n <li><b>Algorithm/Core Database Development</b> - We built our own in-memory database and distributed data analytics pipeline from the ground up, and we have a team of talented researchers working on pattern analysis, streaming analytics, spatial queries, and network graph functions that power our visual engines. We are always looking for practical people who love writing highly optimized code that straddles the line between research and software development.
